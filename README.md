We introduce Craftax-MA and Craftax-Coop, MARL environments written entirely in JAX. Craftax-MA reimplements the exact game mechanics as Craftax, while Craftax-Coop introduces agent heterogeniety, trading and other mechanics that require cooperation for success!

## Basic Usage
Craftax-MA and Craftax-Coop conform to the JaxMARL interface, and can be simply used as follows
```python
import jax
from craftax.craftax_env import make_craftax_env_from_name

rng = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
rng_reset, rng_act, rng_step = jax.random.split(rng, 3)

# Create environment
env = make_craftax_env_from_name("Craftax-Coop-Symbolic")

# Get an initial state and observation
obs, states = env.reset(rng_reset)

# Pick random actions
rng_act = jax.random.split(rng_act, env.num_agents)
actions = {agent: env.action_space(agent).sample(rng_act[i]) for i, agent in enumerate(env.agents)}

# Step environment
obs, states, rewards, dones, infos = env.step(rng_step, states, actions)
```

## Setup
To get started with using the environment please install all needed dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training Baselines
The `baselines` directory provides training scripts needed to evaluate IPPO, MAPPO and PQN against the Craftax-MA and Craftax-Coop environments.

To use, following the steps below:
- Setup your environment according to the steps in the `SETUP` section
- Create a config yaml file and place in the `baselines/config` directory 
  - Default configurations for experiments are already provided
  - Make sure to modify the WandB information for appropriate logging
- Run one of the provided training scripts using the command
```sh
python baselines/<training-script> --config_file=<config-file-name>
```

### Static arena frames (separate IPPO RNN)

CSV logging also saves one full terrain PNG per logged episode in
`<run-output>/arenas/arena_<update>_<env>_<episode_id>.png`.
For `scalars_<update>_<agent>_<env>.csv.gz`, use its `episode_id` column to select
the image. IDs start over in each logging phase and are scoped by update and env.
The images contain terrain only: no agents, passive mobs, predators, item overlays
or lighting effects. Static map tiles (including resource blocks) are retained.
`SAVE_ARENA_FRAMES: false` disables them; `SAVE_VIDEO` is independent.
Resolution is map size times `VIDEO_PIXEL_SIZE`, with no crop, padding or labels.
For overlays, CSV `player_position_x` is the row and `player_position_y` the column;
pixel centers are `(column + 0.5, row + 0.5) * VIDEO_PIXEL_SIZE`.
The first logged state of each episode supplies the frame. CSV positions come from
the post-step state, so `episode_id` advances on the auto-reset row (`done=1`).
